/**
 * A utility for calculating the smallest circle that encompasses a set of 2D
 * points.
 * 
 * The utility can use any of four algorithms for forming the circle.
 * 
 * CENTROID - The centroid of the points is used as the center of the circle with
 * the radius being the largest distance from any point to that centroid.
 * Solution is order O(n).
 * 
 * N3 - The order O(n^3) version of the N4 algorithm. It is a bit more complex
 * than N4, but is just a streamlined version of N4 and should return the same
 * circle within precision error.
 * 
 * N4 - The order O(n^4) algorithm that returns the smallest circle that will
 * contain all of the points. This will return the same solution as Nimrod
 * Megiddo's O(n) algorithm.
 * 
 * COLLAPSING_BUBBLE - An order O(n) algorithm that returns the same solution as
 * N4 approximately 80+% of the time. The remaining ~20% the algorithm returns
 * circles that are generally a fraction of percent larger than the optimal
 * solution of N4 and Megiddo's O(n) algorithm.
 * 
 * Future improvements to this class would likely include an implementation of
 * Megiddo's O(n) algorithm as well as a version of this utility for spherical
 * polygons.
